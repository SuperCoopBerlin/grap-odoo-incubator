This module is useful in the following case:

* Odoo is implemented in a country with simple Taxes system, (Like in France)
  with generaly only one Tax type='percent'. (VAT)
* Users define allways product price with VAT included. (or allways excluded)
* Some customers / suppliers wants quotation / invoices with the other system


Possibility to switch between Price VAT Included and Price VAT Excluded
when editing a Account Invoice
