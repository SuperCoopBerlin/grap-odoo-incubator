This module extends the functionality of point of sale to allow you to
load again a done PoS Order in the point of sale to make extra operation on it.

For the time being, only the reprint of the bill is allowed.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* For a reason of cached data, it is only possible to reprint an order of
  the current session. Printing older orders could be possible if we load
  previous statements.

* It could be great to add an other button 'Refund' to create an refund order
  directly in the Point of Sale.

* It could be great to add an other button 'Invoice' to create have the
  possibility to reedit the invoice.

**Migration Note**

For more recent version, please use OCA modules. (``pos_order_return``,
``pos_order_mgmt``)
