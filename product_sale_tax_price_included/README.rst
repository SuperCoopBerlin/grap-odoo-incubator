**The four use cases**

In Customer taxes, there's a boolean called "Tax included in Price".

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grap/grap-odoo-incubator/8.0/product_sale_tax_price_included/static/description/taxes_creation.png

**According to the customer taxes** of the product (choosen in accouting part), there are 4 possibilities :

- The sale price **AND** the sale price without taxes are displayed.

- **Or** the sale price **AND** the sale price with taxes.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grap/grap-odoo-incubator/8.0/product_sale_tax_price_included/static/description/product_tax_excluded.png

- **Or** if you choose two customer taxes, one included in price, and the other one not included in price,
  this module displays the sale price and the two calculated prices.

- **And lastly** if there's no taxe choosen, only the normal price is displayed.
